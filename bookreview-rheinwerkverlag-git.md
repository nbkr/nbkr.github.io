# Bookreview, Git by Bernd Ã–ggl and Michael Kofler

Git is one of those tools you just use. You learn it while using it. Looking
up commands as you need them, right?

This approach is quite handy as it minimises the time you need to get familiar 
with the tool. However it comes with the downside, that you don't get into the details
and you might not even know what you're missing.

When I visited one of my regular book sites [Rheinwerk Verlag](https://www.rheinwerk-verlag.de/) I saw
that they have an entire book to git. So I thought why not, maybe there is something I
haven't seen yet.
